<h1>Hi my name is Laura and this is my first website ever created.</h1>
<p>I am seventeen years old and while having a lot of spare time, I am learning how to create my own webpage. In a few months, I am going to study Econometrics at the Erasmus in Rotterdam. This knowledge will help me further in my career.</p>
